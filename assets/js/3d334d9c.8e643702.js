At the end, he mentioned that creating a built-in function is the first test for new recruits joining the SQL team of OceanBase. Though having no intention of looking for a new job, I was so intrigued by this ",(0,o.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"first test"}),'. I am not a database administrator, so I have not spent much time working with databases until lately when I started learning about top-notch home-grown database products for job reasons. As far as my job description is concerned, I have "walked out of my circle" to do the test. After reading posts from popular IT communities and participating in open online courses, I was deeply impressed by the vigorous momentum of the database ecosystem in China. I want to say thank you to database developers and engineers who have shared their experience, which enables laymen like me to quickly get on track. Benefiting from their good deeds, I would like to take this opportunity to make my contributions to the OceanBase community, hoping that you might find it useful.']})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},8453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>i,x:()=>r});var o=n(6540);const a={},s=o.createContext(a);function i(e){const t=o.useContext(s);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:i(e.components),o.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
